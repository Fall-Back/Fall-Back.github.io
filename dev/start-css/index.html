<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Sizing issues:</strong><br>
    Borders normally should be the same size regardless of font size.<br>
    Vertical Rhythm (VR) preserved by using either padding or margin tweaks to offset border- Border Compensation Tweaks (BCT).<br>
    VR is calculated by REMs so adjustment to <code>html</code> font-size should adjust whole VR.<br>
    However, doing this DOES NOT adjust the BCT.<br>
    So, perhaps have to consider changing all BCT values to <code>calc()</code> so that <code>html</code>  font-size adjustments (e.g. in Media Queries) will also adjust BCT.<br>
    Although, it's possible to make font-size changes on the <code>body</code>  font-size, so this may not be necessary.
</p>

<p>
    Double bottom space fix needs thought in how it relates to borders.
    The border/padding combination works fine, but the bottom margin of the inner elements will be a full spacing-unit, not adjusted for border-width.
    This means the combined margin is 1 full spacing unit and this negates the BCT.
    Maybe will have to make BCT margin-based and not padding based after all?
