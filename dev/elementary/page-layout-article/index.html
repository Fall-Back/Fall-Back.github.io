        <article>

                <h1>Page Layout - Article</h1>
            </header>

            <p>There are currently two main page layouts available in Elementary - an 'article' layout where the focus of the page is text content, and a 'listing' layout, the purpose of which is to is to provide a list of articles.</p>

            <p>This article page can contain any information or utility that you need. In addition there are some conventions in play:</p>

            <p>This wrapped in an article:</p>

            <figure>
                <details>
                    <summary>Code example</summary>
                    <pre><code>&lt;article&gt;
    This is some longer text to test that the pre overflows with scroll. The example below didn't do that and broke things so I wanted to check this example too.
&lt;/article&gt;</code></pre>
                </details>
            </figure>

            <h2>Full-width container</h2>

            <p>By default there's a maximum width to elements at this level to prevent long lines of text and improve readability. To break out of this restraint simple wrap you content in a div.</p>

            <div>
                <figure>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Code example</summary>
                        <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code example is wrapped in a div - the maximum width is not applied to divs at this level, so it breaks out of the main column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                    </details>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <h2>Sidebar Bottom</h2>

            <p>This page also demonstrates the optional bottom sidebar.</p>
