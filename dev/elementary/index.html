            <p><b>Elementary is an implementation and extension of <a href="https://github.com/Fall-Back/Start-CSS">Start-CSS</a>.</b></p>

            <p>Whilst the purpose of Start-CSS is to <q>Provide a clean, modern set of styles to apply to well-formed HTML, including improvements for legibility and responsiveness</q>, the purpose of Elementary is to <q>Provide classless HTML patterns for common layout requirements (e.g. navbar, sidebar) and common display requirements (e.g. images, hero, and maybe forms?</q></p>

            <p>The idea is that for simple projects, implementing a comprehensive pattern or UI library may be overkill - and may require additional time to learn. Elementary allows you to follow some simple markup patterns that will create a clean site that's "good enough" for the job.</p>

            <p>Examples include a single page, documentation, simple blog, simple portfolio, simple mockups / concepts, or perhaps as a container for experiments. This site serves as both a pattern library and a real example of what can be done using only Elementary.</p>

            <h2>Customisable</h2>

            <p>Elementary makes heavy use SCSS variables that allow you customise much of the codebase, from colours, fonts, layout specifications and selectors, allowing you to use additional or different markup if you need to.</p>
