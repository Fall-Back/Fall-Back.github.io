Fall-Back is a collection of [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/progressive-enhancement.html) patterns using HTML, CSS and very little Javascript.
Each repository deals with a common HTML pattern and adds CSS and Javascript needed to make it work for the modern web, whilst ensuring that the partern is accessible and still works even if the CSS or Javscript fails to load.

This site makes use of most of the patterns currently available:

* Nav Bar
* Search Form
* SVG
* Off Canavs
* Sticky Footer, and
* Top Bar
