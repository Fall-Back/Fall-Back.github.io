    Progressive enhancement patterns. More to follow.
</p>

<p>This site makes use of most of the patterns currently available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nav Bar</li>
<li>Search Form</li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>Off Canavs</li>
<li>Sticky Footer, and </li>
<li>Top Bar</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition Iâ€™m a big fan of Normalize and inuitcss. These and the Fall-Back patterns form the vast majority of the CSS used for this site. Only a small number of site-specify rules are necessary for this simple design.</p>
