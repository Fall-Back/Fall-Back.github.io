<h2>For Fall-Back</h2>
<h3>The Fall-Back logo</h3>
<p>
  <img src="/img/Erik_Bjerkesjo--thumb.jpg" alt="Photo of a falling man by Erik BjerkesjÃ¶, used as part of the Fall-Back logo." style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px;" />The Fall-Back logo was contrived to demonstrate the 'SVG with an embedded PNG' problem I was having on a real project and it just sort of stuck.<br />
