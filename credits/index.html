<h2>For Fall-Back</h2>
<h3>The Fall-Back logo</h3>
<p>
  <img src="/img/Erik_Bjerkesjo.jpg" width="150" alt="Photo of a falling man by Erik Bjerkesjö, used as part of the Fall-Back logo." style="float:right;margin:20px;" />The Fall-Back logo was contrived to demonstrate the 'SVG with an embedded PNG' problem I was having on a real project and it just sort of stuck.<br />
  The 'Falling Man' image is the work of <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Erik_Bjerkesjo.jpg">Erïk Bjerkesjö</a> and is released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">Creative Commons CC BY-SA 3.0 licence</a>
